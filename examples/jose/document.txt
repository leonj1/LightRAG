This is a sample document for testing the update functionality.

LightRAG is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework that allows you to:
1. Ingest documents
2. Process and chunk them
3. Create embeddings
4. Build a knowledge graph
5. Query the knowledge base with different strategies

When a document is updated, we need to handle it efficiently. This sample file will be used to test the update process.

The update.py script provides three strategies:
- replace: Delete the old document and ingest the new one
- add: Keep the old document and add the new one
- auto: Choose strategy based on change percentage threshold

Let's see how it works!
