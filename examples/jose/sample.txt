This is a sample text file for testing the LightRAG ingestion script.

LightRAG is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework that allows you to:
1. Ingest documents
2. Process and chunk them
3. Create embeddings
4. Build a knowledge graph
5. Query the knowledge base with different strategies

This sample file will be used to test the ingestion process with a progress bar.
The script should display information about this file and then ingest it into LightRAG.

Let's see how it works!
